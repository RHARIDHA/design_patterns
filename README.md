# Exercise 1 - Design Patterns Use Cases

This project demonstrates six use cases showcasing various software design patterns implemented in Java.

## Behavioral Patterns
1. Observer Pattern: Demonstrates observers notified of state changes in a subject.
2. Strategy Pattern: Demonstrates interchangeable algorithm strategies encapsulated.

## Creational Patterns
1. Singleton Pattern: Ensures single instance of a class.
2. Factory Pattern: Creates objects without exposing creation logic.

## Structural Patterns
1. Adapter Pattern: Converts interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
2. Decorator Pattern: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.

## Coding Guidelines
- One class per file under respective pattern folders.
- Proper exception handling, validations and logging are included.
- No hard coded infinite loops; use proper input and menu handling.
- Console-based demonstration with focus on quality and pattern implementation.

## Running
Navigate to each pattern folder, compile and run the Main.java class.
